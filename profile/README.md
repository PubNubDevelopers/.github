## What is PubNub? 

Our platform helps developers build, deliver, and manage real-time interactivity for web apps, mobile apps, and IoT devices.

Whether businesses need in-app or in-game chat, live audience engagement, multi-user collaboration, or any other form of real-time functionality, we help bring it to life with our suite of purpose-built real-time APIs, SDKs, Solution Kits, integrations and analytics.

The foundation of our platform is the industry’s largest and most scalable real-time edge messaging network. With over 15 points-of-presence worldwide supporting 800 million monthly active users, and 99.999% reliability, you’ll never have to worry about outages, concurrency limits, or any latency issues caused by traffic spikes.
